1) Write a JavaScript function that takes two boolean values, 

isTrue and isFalse. If both are true, return "Both are True." 

If both are false, return "Both are False." Otherwise, return

 "One is True and One is False."

Test case-: isTrue = true, isFalse = false

{
let T = prompt();
let F = prompt();
if (T && !F) {
    console.log("one is true and one is false");
} else {
    console.log("either both are true or both are false");
}

2) Write a JavaScript function that takes three integers, 

x, y, and z. If x is greater than or equal to y and y is greater 

than or equal to z, return true. Otherwise, return false. 

Test case-:X = 5, Y = 7, Z = 9

let X=prompt();
let Y=prompt();
let Z=prompt();
if( X>=Y && Y>=Z)
{
    console.log(true)
}
else
{
    console.log(false)
}

3) Write a JavaScript function that takes an integer n and 

prints a pyramid pattern with consecutive numbers. 

Use a loop for the printing.

Test case-: n = 3

output -:

     1

   232

 34543



4) Write a JavaScript function that takes two integers, 

a and b. If a is greater than b, return the difference 

multiplied by 2. If b is greater than a, return the sum. 

If they are equal, return their product.

Test case:-  a = 8,b = 5


5) Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers

 and rearranges the elements in a way that all even 

numbers come before odd numbers. Implement the 

solution using loops.

Test case-:[4, 7, 2, 9, 6, 5]


6) Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers 

and rotates the elements to the left by a given number of 

positions. Implement the solution using loops.

Test case-: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , position = 2

Write a JavaScript function that takes an integer n and 

prints a pattern of asterisks in the form of a diamond.

 Use a loop for the printing.

Test case-: n = 3

Output-:

    *

   ***

  *****

   ***

    *


7) Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers

 and returns the sum of all prime numbers in the array. 

Use a loop for the calculation.

Test case-: arr = [4, 7, 12, 5, 8, 11]


8) Write a JavaScript function that takes a positive integer n

 and generates a matrix of size n x n filled with 

consecutive numbers in a zigzag pattern. The numbers 

should start from the top-left corner and zigzag 

horizontally and vertically until the entire matrix is filled. 

Implement the solution using loops.

Test case -: n = 4

Expected Output:

 1 2 3 4

 8 7 6 5

 9 10 11 12

 16 15 14 13



9) Write a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of 

integers and returns a new array containing only 

the common elements between the two arrays. 

Implement the solution using loops.

Test case-:arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7] , arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 5]  



10) Write a JavaScript function that takes a string str. If the 

string has more than 5 characters and starts with the 

letter "A," return "Valid String." Otherwise, return 

"Invalid String."

Test case-: str = “Apple”


11) Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers

 and returns the sum of the numbers at even indices 

minus the sum of the numbers at odd indices. 

Implement the solution using loops.

Test case-:[1, 4, 2, 7, 3, 6]



12) Write a JavaScript function that takes an integer n and 

prints the Fibonacci series up to the nth term. Use a 

loop for the generation.

Test case-: n = 8

Output -:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13



13) Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers 

and returns the length of the longest increasing 

subsequence. Implement the solution using loops.

Test case-: arr = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]


14) Write a JavaScript function that takes an integer n. If n is 

even and greater than 10, return "Even and Greater than 

10." If n is odd and less than 5, return "Odd and Less than 5.
" Otherwise, return "Other."

Test case-: n = 7
